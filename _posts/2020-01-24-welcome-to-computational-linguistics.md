Finally, the course web site for Computational Linguistics appears.
This is where homework will be posted and announcements will appear,
updates to the schedule, and so forth.

This represents the third online access point for the course,
the other two being the Piazza site for discussion, and Gradescope
for homework submission and grade reference.
