The notebook (lightly annotated) that was constructed
during class is here:
[20200225-class.ipynb]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ipynb/20200225-class.ipynb)

Or as a zip file:
[20200225-class.ipynb.zip]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ipynb/20200225-class.ipynb.zip)

As a reminder, the word cloud at the end requires installing it,
which you can do in the notebook by typing

```python
!pip install wordcloud
```

(There are other, possibly better, ways to install it, but that worked for me.)
