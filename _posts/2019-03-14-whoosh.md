I hope everyone's having a restful spring break.  Over here, time is racing
by and there was so much to catch up on that I have not yet done what I'd
planned when we last met, which was to come up with some project ideas and
post them for contemplation.  Partly, I'm writing this
just to indicate that I still intend
to do that.
