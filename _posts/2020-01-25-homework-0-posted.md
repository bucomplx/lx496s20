Homework 0 is now ready.  You can download it here:
[hw00.ipynb]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ipynb/hw00.ipynb)

Or if a zip file is easier:
[hw00.ipynb.zip]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ipynb/hw00.ipynb.zip)

It is officially due at the regular time (Monday 11:59pm) but instead of having a 6 hour grace period,
you will have a 3 day grace period.  That is, hand it in before Friday and it's fine.

As you will see the homework has way more reading than it has things
to answer.  It should be relatively clear, but try to work on it before
class, and we can perhaps talk in class about questions that arose if you
are stuck anywhere.
