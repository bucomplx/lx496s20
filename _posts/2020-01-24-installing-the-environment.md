The first thing you need to do is install the software we will be using.

# Anaconda Distribution of Python

You are encouraged (all but required, really)
to install the Anaconda distribution of scientific computing software.
It includes most of the components we will be using through the semester.

- Download from <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>
    - Make sure it's Python 3!
    - Be sure to pick the correct Operating System (i.e., Windows, macOS, Linux)

# Starting Jupyter Notebook
Installing Anaconda will provide an application called Anaconda Navigator.  You can start this, then click the Launch button for Jupyter Notebook.

Alternatively, you can launch it yourself from the command line.  To get to the command line, do one of the following:

- For Windows, search for CMD and run it.
- For macOS, type "terminal" into Spotlight.  You may want to add it to your Dock (once it is running, it will be in the Dock; at that point you can right-click, Options, Keep in Dock).  To find Terminal manually, you can look in Applications inside Utilities.

Once at the command line, type `jupyter notebook` to start it.

When Jupyter Notebook has started, you will be presented with the web interface in the browser.

Click New and then choose Python3 to create a new Ipython3 notebook.
