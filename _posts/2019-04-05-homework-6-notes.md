I've gotten a couple of questions about Homework 6.
I have added a couple of notes to that page. 

But in brief:

1. A note about the ratio of adjective to nouns and why your numbers
might not match mine.

2. A note about which version of the Federalist Papers to pick
from the Gutenberg Project site.

2. A note about defining `authors` before using it to create
`author_set`.  I basically left out any mention of creating `authors`
when I initially posted this homework.

The updates are included here:
