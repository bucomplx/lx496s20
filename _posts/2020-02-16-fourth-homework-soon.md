The fourth homework assignment, finishing up the SHRDLU project,
will be posted soon.  It is not there yet.  It should be there before
mid-morning Monday probably.

The pressure is not super-high, though, because we don't meet this
coming week,
so you can in principle have longer on this homework assignment.

Anyway, just wanted to post an update.  I (Prof. Hagstrom) actually
only just remembered that it wasn't already posted, and it needs a little
bit of work before I make it public.
