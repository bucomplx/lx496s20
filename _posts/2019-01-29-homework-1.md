The first homework is a “just getting comfortable” assignment, based on section 1 and partly on section 2 of the NLTK book, and using exercises already in the book.

Those exercises are: 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 13, 21, 27, 28, 29.

You can send the answers to me in whatever form I can read. Electronic is preferable, just plain text in an email is fine, but so is Word, PDF.  Please include the output (and whatever commentary is necessary) to anything that you do (that is, don't just give me something that I need to run myself).
