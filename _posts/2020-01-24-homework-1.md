As for the homework.  I (Paul) am still tweaking it a little bit to make sure it is doable.
It actually won't take all that long to do when you do it, I believe.
It is still going to be due on Monday night, and it should be posted here
before the end of the day today (Friday).  It will include just the
haiku part and not the graphing part, the graphing part will be
included in homework 2.
