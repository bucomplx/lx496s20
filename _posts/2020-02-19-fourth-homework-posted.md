The fourth homework assignment
(part two of two whose end goal is to model the SHRDLU
conversational robot) is finally ready.
You can download it here:
[hw03-shrdlu.ipynb]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ipynb/hw03-shrdlu.ipynb)

Or as a zip file:
[hw03-shrdlu.ipynb.zip]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ipynb/hw03-shrdlu.ipynb.zip)

This too is long, but like the previous one it is a lot of
reading and absorbing with just occasional checks to make sure
it is making sense.

The Gradescope submission procedure for it should be ready soon, the due
date is whatever Gradescope tells you it is, but should be
a little over a week from now.
