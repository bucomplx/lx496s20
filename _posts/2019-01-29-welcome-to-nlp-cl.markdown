And, here we go.  Welcome to Spring 2019, and welcome to the
Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics
course.

Announcements will be posted here, updates to the schedule,
etc.  I will probably not even bother handing out a printed
copy of the schedule.  If you would like to print it out, go
to the schedule page here and do so.  It is likely to change
as the semester proceeds.

The course information page has stuff about the course
requirements and my office hours, etc.
