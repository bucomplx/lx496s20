Ok, that's it.  Here are a couple of links from the relatively
miscellaneous last class.

First: if you were getting some "Sorry, what?" errors on Homework 8,
check the page for it now.  There was one typo that I fixed
(changing `idfun` to `isthis`).

Second: The last day of finals this semester is May 11.

And: some links to things we talked about:
