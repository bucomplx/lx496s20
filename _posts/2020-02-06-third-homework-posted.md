The third homework assignment
(basically part one of two whose end goal is to model the SHRDLU
conversational robot) is ready.
You can download it here:
[hw02-semantics.ipynb]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ipynb/hw02-semantics.ipynb)

Or as a zip file:
[hw02-semantics.ipynb.zip]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ipynb/hw02-semantics.ipynb.zip)

It is a little bit long, so set aside some time for it.  There aren't all that many
tasks to do, but there's a fair amount of reading and following along.
The Gradescope submission procedure for it should be ready soon, the due
date is whatever Gradescope tells you it is, but just a little short of a
week from now.
