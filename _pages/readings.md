The primary book for the class is the NLTK textbook,
[Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.nltk.org/book/)
by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper, 2016.
This is the second version of the book,
which was published by Oâ€™Reilly in its first edition.
The first edition was for Python 2,
the second version (but perhaps not the second *edition*)
is for Python 3 and NLTK 3.

Thomas Graf is working on a textbook, the draft of which
can be found here:
[Lecture Notes](https://github.com/StonyBrook-Lin637-S18/main/blob/master/pdf/999_CompleteLectureNotes.pdf).

Other things may go here as they come up.
Some readings may be protected by a password.
You will have gotten this password in class.
