    "\n",
    "A quick word about SHRDLU.  [SHRDLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU) is Terry Winograd's program from 1971 that could converse about things in its very limited universe of a block world.  You can find a video of it doing its thing [on YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo4RvYJYOzI).  You can see it doing a lot of pretty interesting things.  Learning names for things, remembering what it was talking about, moving blocks around, making plans to accomplish goals.  Ours will not be that sophisticated.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're going to do here is make a \"little\" version of this.  It's still \n",
    "actually pretty extensive, but there will still be a lot left to do by the\n",
    "time we're done.\n",

    "to Python than they are to NLTK, but by the end you should have a cool little\n",

    "- display module to show the current state of the world\n",
    "- user input loop\n",
    "- interpretation of user input to respond\n",

    "\n",
    "> Also, it is probably worth taking a second to talk about the CP rules below themselves.  Remember how these rules work from the previous homework.  The parts in square brackets define features, and we are defining two features here.  One is `SEM` (for \"SEMantics\") and one is `CT` (for \"Clause Type\").  The `?cbar` and `?ct` and `?tp` are variables.  They name the values that appear on the right, and they are used to set values on the left.  So the first rule says \"Let's call the `CT` value (from `CBAR`) `?ct` and the `SEM` value (from `CBAR`) `?cbar`.  We can build a `CP` out of a `CBAR` (this corresponds to a tree that has just a single branch from CP down to CBAR, no specifier), and the `SEM` value of `CP` will be `?cbar` (so, just the same as that value was for `CBAR`) and the `CT` value of `CP` will be `?ct` (so, just the same as that value was for `CBAR`).  Essentially, the `SEM` and `CT` features are being \"passed up\" from `CBAR` to `CP`.  That's what the first rule says.  The second rule says that the `SEM` and `CT` features are being passde up from `TP` to `CBAR` too.  So, this is a lot of nothing, semantically speaking, but we may be tweaking some of this later."
